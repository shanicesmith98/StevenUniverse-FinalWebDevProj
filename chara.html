                            <p>The titular protagonist of the series, Steven Quartz Universe is the enthusiastic youngest and only male member of the Crystal Gems. He's the son of Greg Universe and Rose Quartz. A human-Gem hybrid as a result of his parentage, Steven is an extraordinarily unique being with innate powers beyond that of both normal humans and Gems. While only a child, Steven has steadily grown from a tag-along to the Crystal Gems into the team's unofficial leader thanks to his kind-hearted nature and resourcefulness. Though he is part of a monumental legacy, Steven is devoted to fulfilling his destiny as protector of humanity, just as his mother was before him.</p>

                                            <p>In her introduction, Peridot is a technician dispatched by the Gem Homeworld to check on remaining Gem installations on Earth; her appearance late in the first season becomes an ominous sign that the Crystal Gems are under threat from Homeworld. Stranded on Earth, Peridot becomes a recurring antagonist in the first half of the second season before being eventually captured and convinced to ally with the Crystal Gems to defuse the Cluster. her character arc centers around learning to outgrow Homeworld’s hierarchical, utilitarian mindset and appreciate the value of friendship, individuality, and life on Earth, eventually declaring herself a member of the Crystal Gems and forming a close relationship with Lapis Lazuli. She is cranky and self-aggrandizing in demeanor, but demonstrates willingness to learn from her mistakes and to treat others with greater respect and kindness. Her gemstone is a triangular peridot embedded in her forehead, and she discovers in the third season that she has the ability to telekinetically control metal objects.</p>
